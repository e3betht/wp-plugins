=1= Treeline Design Contact Form 7 Double-check Email Field =1=

This plugin is designed to allow you to compare two email addresses and 
verify that they were entered the same in each field. This is the same as
you usually see with an email field and a confirm email field. If the email
addresses do not match, an error is produced.
